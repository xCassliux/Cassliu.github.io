     <h3> Short reflection </h3>
     <pre> 
The website is 4 HTML and 1 CSS and some of the pictures. To design website 
pages there are CSS classes, CSS id, div, span, table, list involved. 
Furthermore, use some of the websites to help me design this website. 
On this website on every page there are mean, body and footer. Next, 
there will be detail explains about the webpage on the technical aspect, 
aesthetics, and aesthetics.

     <h3> Technical </h3>

     <pre>
On this website, there are <span> 4 HTML </span>, <span>1 CSS </span> which is a style sheet and <span>2 images</span>. 
Index.html is the home page. Furthermore, here are 7 CSS and 1 ID. And 1 div 
for the menu. Every page has to have a menu so I set up a div. And there are 
7 classes. These classes are about me, myhobby, horsepic, milkyway, myskillandHobbiestable, 
detailofemployment and myfuture. The ID is the header. I had added 2 pictures.  </pre>
    
     <h3> Accessibility </h3> 
     <ul>
        <li>This website has been testing on turned off the Javascript. The website is still usable. </li> 
        <li>I had the test to use a mobile device and 2 browsers. (There is a picture to show the mobile device interface.)  </liI>
        <li>There are links that can use to access index, past, future and comments pages. </li>
        <li>The pages are all easy to navigate and read. </li>
        <li>There are Back to TOP to go back to the top. So the user doesn’t need to roll back to the top.</li>
    </ul>

     <h3> Aesthetics </h3> 
     <pre>
This website should be easy to read. And one user can find what they want. 
The links will help the user and take them to the page straight forward.
     </pre>
     
     <h4> Colour and Font styles </h4>
     <pre>
User will feel the colour of the page match. There will not be a strange colour. (like: green and red) 
All the pages are use the primary colour is around grey. The <span>Background colour</span> of the <span>ID header</span> is #595959 
and the word is white so have a sharp contrast. All the texts and pictures are in the middle. Centre make 
them in order and clear.
